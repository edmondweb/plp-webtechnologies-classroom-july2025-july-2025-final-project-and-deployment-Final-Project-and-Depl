                    <h2>About Kerniel Foundation</h2>
                    <p>Founded with a deep passion for animal welfare, Kerniel Foundation emerged from a simple yet
                        powerful belief: every dog deserves a chance at a loving, safe home. Our journey began when our
                        founders witnessed the overwhelming number of abandoned and mistreated dogs in our community and
                        decided to take action.</p>

                    <p>What started as a small grassroots effort has grown into a
                        comprehensive foundation that addresses every aspect of dog rescue and rehabilitation. From
                        emergency rescues to long-term behavioral therapy, from community education to policy advocacy,
                        we work tirelessly to create a world where no dog is left behind.</p>

                                <p><em>From the brink of death to a life full of love</em></p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p><strong>The Rescue:</strong> Buddy was found collapsed on a busy highway, severely
                            malnourished and covered in infected wounds. Weighing only 25 pounds when he should have
                            been 60, veterinarians weren't sure if he would survive the night.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Rehabilitation:</strong> After three months of intensive medical care, proper
                            nutrition, and gentle rehabilitation, Buddy slowly regained his strength. Our behavioral
                            team worked patiently to help him overcome his fear of humans and learn to trust again.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Happy Ending:</strong> Today, Buddy is thriving with the Martinez family. "He's
                            our gentle giant," says Maria Martinez. "Buddy has brought so much joy to our home. He loves
                            playing with our children and has become the perfect family companion. It's hard to believe
                            this confident, loving dog was once so afraid and alone."</p>
                        <p><em>Follow-up: One year later, Buddy has gained healthy weight, loves going on family hiking
                                trips, and has even learned to swim at the local lake!</em></p>

                                <p><em>Overcoming trauma through patience and love</em></p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p><strong>The Rescue:</strong> Luna came to us as a victim of severe neglect and abuse. She was
                            so traumatized that she wouldn't let anyone touch her and spent her first weeks hiding in
                            the corner of her kennel, shaking whenever humans approached.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Rehabilitation:</strong> Luna's recovery required a specialized approach. Our
                            team of behavioral specialists spent months building trust through patient, consistent care.
                            They used positive reinforcement techniques and gradually helped her learn that not all
                            humans would hurt her.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Happy Ending:</strong> The breakthrough came when Luna was placed with
                            experienced foster parents who understood trauma recovery. "The first time Luna wagged her
                            tail, we both cried," recalls foster mom Sarah Chen. The Chens eventually adopted Luna
                            permanently. "She's transformed from a fearful, withdrawn dog into a confident, playful
                            companion who brings light to every room she enters."</p>
                        <p><em>Follow-up: Luna now works as a therapy dog, helping other rescued animals learn to trust
                                humans again. Her gentle nature and patient demeanor make her perfect for this
                                role.</em></p>

                                <p><em>An older dog finds new purpose</em></p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p><strong>The Rescue:</strong> Max, a 9-year-old German Shepherd, was surrendered to us when
                            his elderly owner could no longer care for him. At his age, many people assumed he would be
                            difficult to place, but we believe every dog deserves a chance regardless of age.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Rehabilitation:</strong> Max was already well-trained and gentle, but he
                            struggled with separation anxiety after losing his longtime companion. Our team worked with
                            him on confidence-building exercises and helped him adjust to the shelter environment.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Happy Ending:</strong> Max found his perfect match with retired couple Robert and
                            Linda Thompson. "We specifically wanted an older dog," says Robert. "Max has been the
                            perfect companion for our daily walks and quiet evenings at home. His calm, gentle nature
                            fits perfectly with our lifestyle." Max has also become a beloved visitor at the local
                            nursing home, bringing comfort to residents.</p>
                        <p><em>Follow-up: Two years later, Max continues to thrive in his golden years, proving that
                                older dogs make wonderful companions and deserve loving homes too.</em></p>

                        </div>
                        <p><strong>The Rescue:</strong> Bella was found after being hit by a car, with a severely
                            injured hind leg and multiple fractures. The surgery to save her leg was complex and
                            expensive, but our medical team was determined to give her the best chance at a normal life.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>The Rehabilitation:</strong> Bella's recovery included months of physical therapy,
                            pain management, and learning to walk again. Despite her challenges, she maintained a
                            cheerful, optimistic spirit that inspired everyone who worked with her.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Happy Ending:</strong> The Johnson family fell in love with Bella's resilient
                            spirit. "Her determination to overcome her injuries inspired our whole family," says
                            daughter Emma Johnson, age 12. "Bella taught us that challenges don't define you – how you
                            face them does." Today, Bella runs and plays almost normally, with just a slight limp that
                            doesn't slow her down at all.</p>
                        <p><em>Follow-up: Bella has become a symbol of resilience for our organization and often appears
                                at fundraising events to show others the importance of never giving up on a dog in
                                need.</em></p>
